# SyncraSong Web App
## This is a public repository, subject to change.

### Description
This repository, SyncraSong, is a front-end web application that retrieves from the [SyncraSongAPI](https://github.com/austinkimchi/SyncraSongAPI) (private repository) and displays the data in a user-friendly manner. The application is built using React.js. <br>
This web-application is still in development and not meant for public use.
A lot of the core functionality in UI are still broken. 
The core APIs for fetching playlists are working.

### TODO:
- [x] Implement playlist fetching on service linked account (Spotify/Apple Music)
- [x] Access to RESTAPI for basic functions: get userID, session token
- [ ] Proper login handler (In-progress, some bugs)
- [ ] oAuth link access through front-end side
- [ ] Dark/Light mode implementation
More to come...
