### Description
This repository, SyncraSong, is a front-end web application that retrieves from the [SyncraSongAPI](https://github.com/austinkimchi/SyncraSongAPI) (private repository) and displays the data in a user-friendly manner. The application is built using React.js. <br>
This web-application is still in development and is almost ready for public usage.
The core APIs for fetching playlists are working.

### TODO:
- [ ] Transfer functionality
- [ ] UI elements dragging functionality (to stage to transfer playlist)
- [ ] UI elements clicking functionality (to stage to transfer playlist)
- [ ] (API-side) Set up transfer implementation, passing Array of IDs[], fromProvider, toProvider.
- [ ] Dark/Light mode implementation
More to come...

### Completed Tasks:
- [x] Implement playlist fetching on service linked account (Spotify/Apple Music)
- [x] Access to RESTAPI for basic functions: get userID, session token
- [x] oAuth link access through front-end side
- [x] Proper login handler (some bugs)
